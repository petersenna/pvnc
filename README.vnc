VNC Source Distribution for Windows platforms
=============================================

VNC is Copyright RealVNC Ltd. 2002 and Copyright AT&T Laboratories Cambridge
1996-2001.  This software is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence
as published by the Free Software Foundation.  See the accompanying licence.txt
file for the conditions under which the software is made available.

VNC also contains code from other sources.  See the Acknowledgements section
below, and the individual files for details of the conditions under which
they are made available.

There are two programs here in the two subdirectories:

	vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for Win32.

	winvnc - this is the VNC server for Win32. It allows a Windows desktop
	       to be accessed remotely using a VNC viewer.

Both programs have been built using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, and appropriate
build settings are provided in this source distribution.
