VNC Source Distribution for Windows platforms
=============================================

Based on VNC 3.3.7 for Windows

This is a modifyed version of VNC server for Windows that do not accept connections for security. It only allows reverse connection and using Winrar generates a very small installer that fits in only 237 kB.

The same binary works from Windows 95 to Windows 7. :-)
