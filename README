VNC Source Distribution for Windows platforms
=============================================

Based on VNC 3.3.7 for Windows

The original source code is at: http://www.realvnc.com/dist/vnc-3.3.7-winsrc.zip

This is a modified version of VNC server for Windows that do not accept connections for security. It only allows reverse connection(server connecting to client), and using Winrar generates a very small installer that fits in only 237 kB.

The same binary works from Windows 98 to Windows 7. :-)
